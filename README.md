Light Markdown Editor - A Google Chrome Extension

Light Markdown Editor is an editor for Markdown documents running in
Google Chrome.

lightmd does not rely on a backend. It does not send user generated
content to any external server.

lightmd uses the following libraries:

  * [markdown-js](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js)
  * [Ace](http://ace.c9.io/)
  * [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
  * [icoMoon](http://icomoon.io/) icons (5 icons, embedded in icons.css)

Any parsing quirks present in markdown-js is therefore also present
here.

lightmd is shared under the [MIT License](https://github.com/jorgenys/lightmd/blob/master/LICENSE).

Files under extenstion/lib are external dependencies and have their own
licenses.
